Description: Provide simple functions to (i) compute a class of 
  multi-functionality measures for a single ecosystem for given 
  function weights, (ii) decompose gamma multi-functionality 
  for multiple ecosystems into a within-ecosystem component 
  (alpha multi-functionality) and an among-ecosystem component 
  (beta multi-functionality). In each case, the correlation 
  between functions can be corrected for. Based on biodiversity 
  and ecosystem function data, this software also facilitates 
  graphics for assessing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning 
  relationships across scales.
